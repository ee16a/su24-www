    <p>
        The EECS 16AB series (Designing Information Devices and Systems) is a pair of introductory-level courses introducing students to EECS. The courses have a particular emphasis on how to build and understand systems interacting with the world from an informational point of view. Mathematical modeling is an important theme throughout these courses, and students will learn many conceptual tools along the way. These concepts are rooted in specific application domains. Students should understand why they are learning something.
    </p>
    <p>
        An important part of being a successful engineer is being able to identify the important and relevant structure in a complex problem while ignoring minor issues. EECS 16A focuses on modeling as an abstraction: how can we see the relevant underlying structure in a problem? It introduces the basics of linear modeling, largely from a "static" and deterministic point of view. EECS 16B deepens the understanding of linear modeling and introduces dynamics and control, along with additional applications. Finally, CS 70, which can be thought of as the third course in this sequence (except without any labs), introduces additional discrete structures for modeling problems and brings in probability.
    </p>
    <p>
        In EECS 16A in particular, we will use the application domains of imaging and tomography, smartphones and touchscreens, and GPS and localization to motivate and inspire. Along the way, we will learn the basics of linear algebra and, more importantly, the linear-algebraic way of looking at the world. The emphasis will be on modeling and using linear structures to solve problems; the class is not just focused on how to do computations. We will learn about linear circuits, not merely as a powerful and creative way to help connect the physical world to what we can process computationally, but also as an exemplar of linearity and as a vehicle for learning how to do design. Circuits also provide a concrete setting in which to learn the key concept of "equivalence" --- an important aspect of abstraction. Our hope is that the concepts you learn in EECS 16A will help you as you tackle more advanced courses and will help form a solid conceptual framework that will help you learn throughout your career.

        EECS 16A is an introductory-level course that introduces students to the systems side of EECS. It emphasizes systems that interact with the world from an informational point of view. Design-oriented modeling and analysis is an important theme throughout this course, and we anticipate that you’ll learn many mathematical concepts and tools and techniques along the way. These are rooted in a broad spectrum of applications, including many outside the traditional boundaries of EECS.
    </p>
    <p>
        A successful engineer is able to cut through clutter and identify the important, relevant structure in a complex system. EECS 16A focuses on modeling as abstraction. It introduces the basics of linear modeling, largely from a deterministic point of view. It also explores linear dynamic systems and signal processing principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subsequent courses, such as CS 70, introduce additional discrete structures for modeling problems; deepen your fluency with proof techniques; and introduce the analysis of random phenomena through the framework of probability theory.
    </p>
    <p>
        EECS 16A delves into the applications of linear algebra, exploring its impact on fields such as imaging, signals and systems, machine learning, and other modern areas. We begin with the foundational principles of matrix analysis, emphasizing a perspective that extends beyond mere computation as we adopt linear-algebraic tools to understand and solve problems encountered in the real world. The concepts in EECS 16A should help you form a solid conceptual framework and equip you to explore more advanced subjects.

        <!-- Summer 2024-->

        <p>
            Our objective is to help you become the best engineer you can be, and grades are not everything. The various components of the class -- homework, labs, and exams -- are designed explicitly with this in mind. Every challenge is a growth opportunity. You will have the opportunity to gain points in the course through completing your homework and attending labs as well as through the exams.
        </p>

        <p>
            This course is not graded on a curve. We will set absolute thresholds for performance that will map to grade boundaries. We encourage you to discuss the course material with each other and teach each other new ideas and concepts that you learn. Teaching the material is one of the best ways to learn, so discussing course material with colleagues in the class is a win-win situation for everyone. Grades are not everything, far from it, but that said, here is the breakdown for grading for this class:
        </p>
        <!-- Babak's iteration-->
     <!--    <p>
            Our objective is to help you cultivate the traits and skills of a successful engineer.  We know that your grades are important to you, and we take them quite seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
            But please stay cognizant of the fact that grades are not everything. The various components of the course—homework, discussions, labs, and exams—are designed explicitly with this in mind. Every challenge is a growth opportunity. You’ll have plenty of opportunities—through your homework, labs, exams, discussions on Ed, other interactions with your peers and with the teaching staff to demonstrate your skills set and fluency with the subject matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            We encourage you to collaborate when appropriate, and to teach each other the new ideas and concepts that you learn, as you go through the course. To teach the material is one of the best ways to learn. Accordingly, discussing course material with peers in the class is a win-win situation for everyone. Notwithstanding a holistic view, which we want you to adopt of grades, here’s a table that breaks down the various components of the course, and their corresponding weights in determining your final course grade.

        <h3>Exam Clobber Policy</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="secondChance"></a>
        <p>
            This course spans a fairly broad set of ideas and concepts within a short period of time, and hence sustained and consistent effort and investment are critical to your success in this class. Similarly, by far the most common operating mode we have observed in previous students who struggled and/or failed this class was attempting to do the bare minimum in general and then catch up/cram right before the exams.
        </p>
<!--         <p>
            This course spans a broad set of ideas and concepts within a short period of time. Accordingly, it’s critical that you take ownership of, and invest in, your learning, and maintain a sustained, consistent, and efficient effort to succeed. The most common signature of previous students who struggled with, and even failed, this course was that they engaged with the course a bare minimum in most weeks, and then made a fruitless effort to “cram” before exams.  This is not a formula for success.
        </p> -->
        <p>
            To give students a ‘second chance’, we will provide the opportunity to clobber a midterm to <b>students who make an honest attempt on the exam. If you do not take a midterm or give it an honest attempt, you will not qualify for the clobber for that midterm.</b>
        </p>
<!--         <p>
            To give students a ‘second chance’, we provide you with the opportunity to clobber a midterm.  To take advantage of this opportunity, you must <b> redo the midterm that is to be clobbered. Without the midterm redo submitted by the deadline that the teaching staff will announce, you will not qualify for the clobber. </b>
        </p> -->
<!--         <p>
            <b> Midterm 1 can only be clobbered by Midterm 2.  And Midterm 2 can only be clobbered by Midterm 3.  There is no clobber for Midterm 3. </b>
        </p> -->
        <p>
            <!-- <p> <p> <font color="red"> For each midterm, if you complete the midterm redo, we will replace your previous midterm score with 85% of your immediately subsequent exam score if it would help your grade. We will use the following formula: </i> </font> </p> -->
            For each midterm, if you qualify for the clobber, we will replace your corresponding midterm score with 85% of your final exam score if it would help your grade. We will use the following formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>clobbered midterm score = max(original midterm score, 0.85 * score on final exam) </i>
        </p>
        <!-- <p> <p> <font color="red"> So, if you receive a MT2 score that is 1.5 σ_2 above the mean of MT2, you’ll get—as your clobber score for MT1—0.85*1.5 σ_1 above the mean of MT1.  Here, σ_1 and σ_2 denote the standard deviations of MT1 and MT2, respectively. </font> </p> -->

<!--        <p> <p> <font color="purple"> <b> 9/30/2020: </b> </font> <b> As OH becomes more popular, we will be implementing a policy where TAs will spend about 10 minutes with each student, and move down the queue after this time (this applies when other students are on the queue).

        Homework parties are your chance to meet and interact with other students, while also having the chance to get help from GSIs, tutors, and faculty. We expect students to treat each other with respect during homework parties as well as during all other parts of the class, including interactions on Ed, discussion, and office hours. Remember that each of you is coming into a class with different experiences and backgrounds -- use this as an opportunity to learn from one another.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>HW Party will be held in Soda 410 on Mondays/Wednesdays from 4:30-6:30PM and Fridays from 9-11AM. Attending homework party is highly encouraged and is a great way to find a study group!</b> Students are expected to help each other out, and if desired, form ad-hoc "pickup" homework groups in the style of a pickup basketball game.

     <h3>Homework and Self-Grade Submission</h3>
     <a class="anchor" id="hwSgSubmission"></a>
     <p>
         To receive any credit for homework, you must follow all of the below steps.
     </p>
     <ol>
         <li><b>Do the homework.</b></li>
         <li><b>Submit the homework by Friday night at 11:00 PM Pacific Time.</b> We will accept submissions for full credit as long as your submission makes it into Gradescope before the late deadline of 11:59 PM. <b>Submissions on or after 11:59 PM will not be accepted.</b> We strongly recommend you use this one hour grace period to protect against technical issues and have your homework finished by 11:00 PM. You need to turn in a .pdf file consisting of your written-up solutions that also includes an attached pdf "printout" of your Jupyter notebook code on Gradescope. In addition, Gradescope has an option to associate pages of your work to each homework problem. You must select the relevant pages for every problem. <b>Any homework submissions that are turned in without the code “printout” (or screenshot) attached will receive a zero on the coded Jupyter notebook portions of the homework. Any problems without pages selected will receive zero credit.</b> If you have any questions about the format of a homework submission, please go to office hours or homework party. We will provide HW accommodations for students who have letters of accommodations from DSP services; other accommodation requests will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</li>
         <li><b>Read the solutions.</b> Official solutions will be released after the homework submission deadline.</li>
         <li><b>Do the self-grade.</b> Grade your submitted work accordingly for every part of every problem in the homework on a simple coarse scale as described in the table below. Enter your self-grades into the posted self-grade form for that homework, which will generate a .txt file, and upload that .txt file to the appropriate self-grade assignment on Gradescope.

             </div>
             </p>
         <li> Note: You must justify self-grades of 2, 5 or 8 with a comment. Grades of 0 and 10 do not need to be justified (you can just write "Incorrect" or "Correct"). If you are really confused about how to grade a particular problem, you should post on Ed. This is not supposed to be a stressful process.
         Just like we encourage you to use a study group for doing your homework, we strongly encourage you to have others help you in grading your assignments while you help grade theirs.
         </li>
         <li>
             <b> Submit the self-grade by the Monday night following the homework deadline at 11:00 PM Pacific Time.</b> (For example: Homework 0 is due on Friday 6/21 at 11:00 PM. The following Monday, 6/24, at 11:00 PM, your Homework 0 self-grades will be due.) We will accept submissions for full credit as long as your submission makes it into Gradescope before the late deadline of 11:59 PM. <b>We will accept late self-grades up to a week after the original homework deadline for 75% credit on the associated homework assignment.</b> If you don't enter a proper self-grade after one week, you are giving yourself a zero on that assignment.
         </li>
         <p>
             In summary, you must do the homework, turn it in on time, read the solutions, do the self-grade, and turn it in on time. <b> Unless all of these steps are done, you will get a zero for that assignment.</b>
         </p>

    <h3>Self-Grade Walkthrough</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="sgWalkthrough"></a>

    </p>

    <h3>Reader Grades</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="readerGrades"></a>
    <p>Course readers are going to be grading and sending you occasional comments. <b>Your own scores will be used in computing your final grade for the course, adjusted by taking into account reader scores so that everyone is fairly graded effectively on the same scale. </b>For example, if we notice that you tend to give yourself 5s on questions where readers looking at your homeworks tend to give you 8s, we will apply an upward correction to adjust. <b>Any consistent discrepancy between your self-assigned grades and the reader grades will be flagged and checked for academic dishonesty</b>, so please grade yourself appropriately without attempting to inflate your grades.
        <!-- This correction factor is called the reader adjustment factor. -->

    </p>
    <p>
        Each week, course readers will grade some (not necessarily strict) subset of the problems. These grades and comments serve as an opportunity to receive feedback on the work you’re submitting over the course of the semester. Reader grades will be released on Gradescope about one week after the homework deadline. Homework regrade requests are typically due on Gradescope within 72 hours of reader grades being released. If a regrade request is submitted for a part of a question on the homework, the grader reserves the right to regrade the entire homework and could potentially take points off.
    </p>

    <h3>Homework Effort Policy</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="hwEffort"></a>
    <p>
        Because the point of homework in this class is again to help you learn, not to punish you for making small mistakes, if your final score on any homework is above 8/10, your grade will automatically be bumped up to 100% (10/10). If your final score is less than 8/10, it will be scaled accordingly so that a 6/10 will result in 75% (7.5/10).
    </p>


    <h3>Homework Scoring</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="hwScoring"></a>
    <p>
        The following formula summarizes how homework scores are calculated:
    </p>
    <img src="img/selfgrade_formula.PNG" width="700" style="margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;">

<!-- Drop policy during summer of only one drop -->
    <p>
        <b>We will automatically drop the lowest homework score from your final grade calculation.</b> If you use this drop half-way into the semester, and request another, we cannot help you. EECS47D students will not have their lowest homework score dropped.

    </p>
    </a>

    <h3>Participation in Discussion</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="participation"></a>
    <p>
        Discussion is a key component to learning the material in this class, and to keep you motivated and on track, discussion participation will count towards your grade. Every week, discussion will be held on Monday through Thursday (with the exception of the first day of class and holidays). Different material will be covered on each day, so you must attend the section you enrolled in on each day of the school week. Regardless of counting towards your grade, <b>we highly encourage you to attend discussion sections</b>, as a big part of your learning will be done in this interactive, classroom setting. Discussion sections will take place in-person.
    </p>

<!-- Didn't account for Midterm 1 and Midterm 2 discussions, so two free points -->
<!--     <p>
        Participation is worth a maximum of 25 points. This is measured by discussion attendance. For each discussion section that you attend, you will fill out an attendance form to count your participation. You must attend 25 discussion sections throughout the summer to get full participation points. Please note that this number is the minimum required for full credit, but you are highly encouraged to attend more discussions.
    </p> -->
    <p>
        Participation is worth a maximum of 25 points. This is measured by discussion attendance. For each discussion section that you attend, you will fill out an attendance form to count your participation. You must attend 23 discussion sections throughout the summer to get full participation points. Please note that this number is the minimum required for full credit, but you are highly encouraged to attend more discussions.
    </p>
<!--     <p>
        If you do not get full credit, the number of discussion points you earn will be equivalent to the number of discussions you attend; e.g., if you attend 20 discussions, you will have 20 points in this category.
    </p> -->
    <p>
        If you do not get full credit, the number of discussion points you earn will be equivalent to the number of discussions you attend plus two; e.g., if you attend 20 discussions, you will have 22 points in this category.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discussion sections are a great way to apply concepts taught in lecture to practice problems, interact with enthusiastic and dedicated TAs, and collaborate with peers in a smaller group setting. It’s a great way to meet other students in the course, and we notice that students who regularly attend discussions find the homeworks and exams more approachable and manageable.
    </p>
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        The form (<a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/rHnQ3AimyKxKE6VP7">linked here</a>)for indicating whether you opt-in or opt-out of discussion participation is due by <b>Friday, September 15th at 11:00 PM Pacific Time</b>. This gives you the opportunity to try out discussion sections for the first couple of weeks before deciding, as you may not change your decision later on. We will be tracking attendance starting from 8/28, so make sure to fill out the attendance form for every discussion you attend from then on (unless you are 100% sure you want to opt-out). Again, please fill out the form by the deadline and <b>make your decision carefully; your decision is binding</b>. If you do not fill it out, we will assume that you are opting-out.-->

        <h3>Lab Policies</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="labDiscussion"></a>
        <p>
            Labs this semester will be held in-person, except where otherwise stated on Ed. Labs for this class are not open section, <b>you must go to your assigned lab section</b>.
        </p>
<!--         <p>
            Credit for each lab is based on completion and checkoff with a member of lab staff during your assigned lab section. In a checkoff, you will demonstrate your work from portions of the lab and answer conceptual questions related to the lab. You should aim to get checked off by the end of your lab section. If (and only if) you attend your lab section for the whole duration but do not finish in time, you may get checked off at the beginning of your next lab section before starting the following lab. We have the following grading policy for labs: If you complete all the labs, you will receive full lab credit. We will drop your lowest lab score from your final grade calculation. <b>If you miss two labs, you will lose half of your lab grade. If you miss three or more labs, you will receive an F in the class. </b>

         <p><b>Makeup exams will not be scheduled. Alternate exam times will not be provided under any circumstances, except for students requiring specific DSP accommodations. Please contact us privately if you have any concerns.
         </b></p>

         <p>
            Please plan for exams at these times. In case of an emergency on exam day, please email the instructors at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>

        <h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>
        <p>
            We treat all our students with utmost trust and respect, and expect students to return the same trust and respect. In EECS 16A we will have <u>zero-tolerance</u> for academic misconduct. There will be <u>consequences</u> for students that violate that trust and the Berkeley code of conduct. We are committed to enforcing academic honesty, and <u>misconduct cases will be punished in their fullest -- no excuses or special circumstances will be considered.</u> Always seek help, never cheat.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            By default, we treat you with utmost respect and trust, and expect you to not only reciprocate but to also conduct yourselves in a manner becoming of the high standards of our UC Berkeley community.
        </p>
         <p>
             We expect that any item you submit for evaluation reflects your original, bona fide work, and that you have neither provided to, nor received from, anyone excessive or unreasonable assistance that might constitute—to a reasonable observer—an unfair advantage for you or for any of your peers in the class.
         </p>
         <p>
             As a member of the UC Berkeley community, you must act with honesty, integrity, respect for others, and impeccable professional responsibility—and to carry yourselves in a manner consistent with the letter and the intent of the campus <a href="https://conduct.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct/">Code of Student Conduct</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
             You must not violate—nor aid or abet anyone else to violate—our course policies, including any policy that we might convey to you as part of the various course components (such as instructions for a problem set, lab, or exam).
         </p>
         <p>
             More generally, in the course of this semester, you must not commit any act that violates—nor aid or abet anyone else to violate—UC Berkeley, state, or Federal regulations.
         </p>
         <p>
             In EECS 16A we will have zero-tolerance for academic misconduct. Consequences for students who violate the principles outlined above will be severe.
         </p> -->

        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="exceptions"></a>
        <p>
            <b>Any requests for exceptions should be emailed to the instructors at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">. </b>

            Email the exception request as soon as possible, as retroactive exceptions will likely not be approved. Exceptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Examples of situations that merit an exception are medical emergencies and family emergencies. No exceptions will be granted after final exam scores have been released.</p>

            <!-- If you do NOT have DSP accommodations, you must consume your allotted two homework drops before you request a homework extension, or any kind of exception. </b>.
            To request an exception, you must fill out the form as soon as possible, as retroactive exceptions will likely be denied.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’ll handle exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Examples of situations that merit an exception include, but are not limited to, medical or family emergencies.
            <b> The deadline to request an exception is immediately before the start time of the last exam. However, the sooner you let us know, the better.</b>
         <p> -->
         <p>
            Accommodations will be provided to students who have letters of accommodations from the DSP Office.
         </p>
<!--          <p>
             If you face extreme hardship, please email us at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a> as early as you can.  The sooner you alert us that you face an intractable or otherwise overwhelming challenge, the likelier we are to be able to assist you.
         </p> -->

        <h3>Course Communication</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="communication"></a>
        <p>
            <b>The instructors and TAs will post announcements, clarifications, hints, etc. on Ed.</b> So, you must check
            the EECS 16A Ed page frequently throughout the term. (You should already have access to the EECS 16A Summer 2024 <a
                href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/59609/discussion/" target="_blank">Ed</a>. If you do not, please let us know.)
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a question, your best option is to post a message on Ed. The staff will check Ed regularly, and if you use Ed, other students will be able to help you too. When using Ed, please avoid off-topic discussions, and please do not post answers to homework questions before the homework is due. Also, always look for an appropriate category to post the question to (for example, each homework will have its own category, so please post there). That will ensure you get the answer faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your question is personal or not of interest to other students, we encourage you to email us (see the top of this page for all the course emails) rather than making private Ed posts. If you wish to talk with one of us individually, you are welcome to come to our office hours. Please reserve email for the questions you can’t get answered in office hours, in discussion sections, or through Ed.
        </p>

            <b>For any exceptions that are of a personal nature</b>, please contact the instructors at <a
                rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>.
            Technical and homework questions are best resolved in homework party, Ed, and during office hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be challenging for the instructors to gauge how smoothly the class is going. We always welcome any feedback on what we could be doing better. If you would like to send anonymous comments or criticisms, please fill out this anonymous feedback <a href="https://forms.gle/aQVML7xpu6EFfcn69" target="_blank">form</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="collaboration"></a>
        <p>
            We encourage you to work on homework problems in study groups; however, you must always write up the solutions on your own. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must always credit all such sources in your write up, and you must never copy material verbatim. <b>Using previous EECS 16A homework, exam, and lab solutions is strictly prohibited, and will be considered academic misconduct. This is not how you want to start your career as an engineer.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            We expect that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem within your group is an interaction that we strongly encourage. But you should write your homework solution strictly by yourself, and you are not allowed to give your homework to other students to copy. You should never possess a copy (written or digital) of another student’s work. You should acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with, or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework. <b>This is good scholarly conduct</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Collaboration during exams or other designated assessments is strictly forbidden, subject to the <a
                href="https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code" target="_blank">Berkeley Honor Code</a>, <a
                href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/faculty-staff/violations" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>, and the
            parameters of the specific assessment.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>16A Study Group Formation</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="studyGroups"></a>
        <p>
            We believe that an important part of learning is learning with others; your study groups will become a crucial factor to your success in all your classes, including EECS16A. To help you find a study group, we have a course-run study group formation program and associated study groups class. The class is a 1 unit P/NP class in which students will meet weekly with their assigned study groups. We are in the process of forming this class and the class code is TBD.  While participation is completely optional, we highly encourage you to work in groups. Your very first homework will have an opportunity for you to be matched into study groups based on your preferences!
        </p> -->

        <h3>Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="help"></a>
        <p>
            Are you struggling? Please come talk with us! The earlier we learn about your struggles, the more likely it is that we can help you. Waiting until right before an exam or the last few weeks of the semester to let us know about your problems is not an effective strategy - the later it is, the less we will be able to help you.    </p>
        <p>
            Even if you are convinced that you are the only person in the class who is struggling, please overcome any
            feelings of embarrassment or guilt, and come ask for help as soon as you need it -- we can almost guarantee
            you're not the only person who feels this way. Don't hesitate to ask us for help -- we really do care that you
            thrive! You can email <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>,
            or email / talk to any course staff at any time -- we’re happy to help.

        <h3>Health</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="health"></a>
        <p>
            If you have COVID symptoms, please do not attend in-person activities. Instead, keep up with the class by
            watching the lecture videos. Because you only need to attend 25 discussions in-person to receive full credit, you will still be able to receive full participation points even if you are working remotely for a day or two.
            <!-- We will post PDFs of each discussion worksheet on the course website, and post detailed solutions the next day, so you can follow along with discussion asynchronously. -->
            If you miss a lab section, you should
            try to make up the lab during buffer week. However, if you would miss multiple labs or miss the buffer section
            due to illness, please email <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:eecs16a.lab@berkeley.edu">eecs16a.lab@berkeley.edu</a>,
            and we will do our best to accommodate you.
            <!-- If you have contagious symptoms or COVID please do not attend the exam in person and reach out to us well ahead of the exam time (we will handle these situations on a case-by-case basis). -->
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a medical emergency that would prevent you from keeping up with the class asynchronously or would
            prevent you from attending class in-person for a longer duration, please email <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>.

            <li>
                If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class (e.g.,
                family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with the instructor(s) or academic
                advisors in Engineering Student Services. We want to be a resource for you.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is no tolerance for sexual harassment or violence. If your behavior harms another person in this
                class, you may be removed from the class or the University either temporarily or permanently.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have a name and/or pronouns that differ from your legal name, designate a preferred name for use in

        <h3>For solving a dispute:</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/Ombuds" target="_blank">The Ombudsperson for Students</a>  (250 Sproul Hall; 510-642-5754) provides a confidential service for students involved in a University-related problem (academic or administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsman can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students' contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsman, are cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm.

        <h3>For basic needs (food, shelter, etc):</h3>
        <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://basicneeds.berkeley.edu/">The Basic Needs Center</a> provides housing, food, transportation support, among other support needed to thrive at UC Berkeley. Specifically, the <a href="https://pantry.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Food Pantry</a>  (check-in at 1st floor of MLK Student Union) aims to reduce food insecurity among students, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements. The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.

        <h3>Advice</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="advice"></a>
        <p>
            The following tips are offered based on our experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Do the homeworks!</b> The homework is explicitly designed to help you to learn the material as you go along.
            There is usually a strong correlation between homework scores and final grades in the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Keep up with lectures!</b> Discussion sections, labs and homeworks all touch on portions of what we discuss
            in lecture. <b>Students do much better if they stay on track with the course.</b> That will also help you keep
            the pace with your homework and study group.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Take part in discussion sections!</b> Discussion sections are not auxiliary lectures. They are an opportunity
            for interactive learning. The success of a discussion section depends largely on the willingness of students to
            participate actively in it. As with office hours, the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more you
            are likely to benefit from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Please come to office hours!</b> We love to talk to you and do a deep dive to help you understand the
            material better.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Form study groups!</b> As stated above, you are encouraged to form small groups (two to four people) to work
            together on homeworks and on understanding the class material on a regular basis. In addition to being fun, this
            can save you a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up on some point or
            other. Of course, it is your responsibility to ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive
            listening will likely not help you much. And recall the caveat above that you must write up your solutions on
            your own. We strongly advise you to spend some time on your own thinking about each problem before you meet with
            your study partners; this way, you will be in a position to compare ideas with your partners, and it will get
            you in practice for the exams. Make sure you work through all problems yourself, and that your final write-up is
            your own. Some groups try to split up the problems ("you do Problem 1, I'll do Problem 2, then we'll swap
            notes"); not only is this a punishable violation of our collaboration policies, it also ensures you will learn a
            lot less from this course.
